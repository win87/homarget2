                            Once the "Contact Guest" request is made, the guest will receive instant notification to view your profile.  The guest can either accept or reject your request based on the info you provide on the website.  If they accept your offer, a link containing the guest's direct contact info will be sent to you via email.  It will be your job to contact the guest via telephone or email to secure the booking!  The guest's direct contact will not be released if they reject your offer.

                            If your space is no longer available after a booking is confirmed, you may choose to disable your listing to avoid receiving more booking requests from other guests by clicking the confirm booking button.  You may also go back to your profile page and change the first available date to a future date that your tenant will be moving out.  If you have more than one room to offer, no action is required until they are fully booked.  Once booking is confirmed by the guest, further instructions and useful contract templates will be sent to both parties via email.
