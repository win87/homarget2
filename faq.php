                               One of the most popular types of accommodation for studying abroad in America is staying with a local American host family. This means you live with the family as a household member and eat and relax with them. The Americans are renowned for their warmth, generosity and friendliness. Staying with an American family is a very enjoyable and beneficial means of getting to know American people and an excellent way to use and practice your English.

                                The family will treat you as a guest and you will be expected to obey house rules. All families provide a private or shared room (depending on location) with access to all living areas in the house and family meals. In most cases; students will be expected to share the bathroom. Experience has shown us that living with a family is the most interesting and effective way to become fully immersed in your host country's language and culture.
                                Your host family will always do their best to engage you in daily conversation while making you feel as though you are in a "home away from home". Remember your host family will have different customs and habits than perhaps you are accustomed to, and meals will be prepared according to local custom. All host families are within 30 minutes travelling time of the school.

                                <p>1. Am I prepared? Do I have realistic expectations? Host families may not have the same comforts as your home does.</p>
                                <p>2. Am I prepared to live by the house rules? You will be treated as a family member and free to come and go as you wish; however, you will be expected to comply with your family's rules and expectations.</p>
                                <p>3. Can I adjust to unfamiliar food? Eating times could be very different, i.e. 6pm instead of 8pm, and the portions may be smaller or larger than you are used to back home. You should also expect the menu to be different from what you are used to.</p>

                                <p><b>Communication </b>
                                    Clear communication is perhaps the most important ingredient to successfully living with a host family. Only when everyone involved knows what is expected of them - and what to expect in return - can honest relationships develop. To avoid cross-cultural confusion after you move in, make sure to iron out certain details before you descend upon your host family. Ask where you will sleep and store your possessions, which meals you will eat with the family and which you will be expected to prepare for yourself, where you will store any food or snacks you purchase?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is also important to arrange access to laundry facilities, communication technology such as the Internet and telephone, your responsibilities regarding younger children and pets and any chores you will be expected to complete.
You should also ask if the family has any curfew expectations and how they feel about alcohol and tobacco use.

                                </p>
                                <p><b>Cleanliness</b>
                                    While you are meant to feel like a part of your host family while you are living abroad, leaving your dirty laundry all over the floor will not endear you to anyone. Your mother won't be around to remind you, so be sure to up your cleanliness quotient while you are living abroad.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Putting all dirty laundry in a hamper or laundry bag washing laundry on a regular basis, hanging up wet towels and laundry and cleaning your bathroom regularly, will show the family that you are respect them and their home.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are other cleaning tasks should do during your stay such as; changing your sheets weekly, washing up after you prepare food and/or eat a meal or snack, wiping down all kitchen surfaces you may have soiled, keeping all school or work supplies neatly tucked away, leaving any room as clean as you found it and pitching in during a general family clean up.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>Caring</b>
                                    Even if you have spelled out all of your rights and responsibilities, and keep your quarters as neat as a pin, living with a host family will only be truly successful if you put your heart into the endeavor. Anyone can pay rent and become a tenant, but becoming a part of the family and making lasting relationships requires caring.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Show that you care in small ways, such as:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    * Bringing a host or hostess gift when you arrive.

                                    * Offering to cook a traditional meal for the family.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    * Assisting with family scheduling and chores.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    * Duplicating photos that you take of yourself and your host family.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    * Selecting meaningful parting gifts when it is time for you to return home.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Living with a host family should be a time for you to truly experience a new culture. With a little bit of communication, cleanliness and caring, living with a host family will be an exceptional experience that you will never forget!
